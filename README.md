# Text2Image
 
## Description

Text2Image is a simple web-based application that generates images from text prompts. The user provides a description, and the system returns a corresponding AI-generated image. This project demonstrates how text-to-image models can be integrated into a lightweight, front-end application with minimal setup.

The interface is clean and interactive — users can type prompts, view loading states, and get instant images.

## Technologies Used

**HTML5**: Structure of the application.
**CSS3**: Styling and layout of the interface.
**JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: Core logic for handling user input, API calls, and displaying generated images.
**AI Image Generation API**: Backend service (can be integrated with Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or Groq’s image models).
**Loading Animations**: GIFs to enhance the user experience during image generation.
